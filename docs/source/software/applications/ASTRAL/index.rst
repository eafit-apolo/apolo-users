ASTRAL

ASTRAL is a java program for estimating a species tree given a set of unrooted gene trees. ASTRAL is statistically consistent under multi-species coalescent model (and thus is useful for handling ILS). The optimization problem solved by ASTRAL seeks to find the tree that maximizes the number of induced quartet trees in gene trees that are shared by the species tree. The optimization problem is solved exactly for a constrained version of the problem that restricts the search space. An exact solution to the unconstrained version is also implemented and can run on small datasets

ORCA
========

ORCA is a general-purpose quantum chemistry package featuring a variety of methods
including semi-empirical, density functional theory, many-body perturbation, coupled cluster,
and multireference methods. ORCA provides an easy-to-learn input structure and thus high
accessibility of quantum chemical approaches and workflows. The ORCA program package is
mainly developed by Frank Neese, the department of molecular theory and spectroscopy at
the Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Kohlenforschung (MPI KoFo), and the FACCTs GmbH which also
manages commercial licensing to industry. ORCA is generally freely available for academic use.. [1]_

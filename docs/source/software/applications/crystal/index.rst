Description
-------------

A powerful and scalable computational tool for solid state chemistry and physics. CRYSTAL is a general-purpose program
for the study of periodic systems. The code may be used to perform consistent studies of the physical and
chemical properties of crystalline solids, surfaces, polymers, nanotubes and molecules. The CRYSTAL program computes
the electronic structure, structural features, vibrational, magnetic, dielectric and elastic properties of
periodic systems, density functional or various hybrid approximations.

The Bloch functions of the periodic systems are expanded as linear combinations of atom centred Gaussian functions.
Powerful screening techniques are used to exploit real space locality and space symmetry is fully exploited.

A unique feature is the extensive exploitation of symmetry to achieve computational efficiency: 230 space groups,
80 two-sided plane groups, 99 rod groups and helical symmetry, 32 crystallographic point groups and molecular point
group symmetry. The Bloch functions of the periodic systems are expanded as linear combinations of atom centred Gaussian
functions. Powerful screening techniques are used to exploit real space locality. Restricted and unrestricted
calculations can be performed with all-electron and valence-only basis sets with effective core pseudo-potentials.

Extensions:
------------

- **MPP** - An enhanced massive parallel version of the code to allow users to reach an improved scaling in parallel executing on supercomputing resources.
- **CRYSCOR** - local second order MÃ¸ller-Plesset Perturbation Theory - LMP2 for 1D-, 2D- and 3D-periodic non-conducting systems.

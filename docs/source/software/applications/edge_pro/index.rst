EDGE-pro
========

**EDGE-pro** [1]_  (Estimated Degree of Gene Expression in PROkaryotes) is an
efficient software system to estimate gene expression levels in prokaryotic
genomes from RNA-seq data.

EDGE-pro uses **Bowtie2** for alignment and then estimates expression directly
from the alignment results.

EDGE-pro is distributed as a single package containing all the
necessary files, including manual, source code [2]_  , executables and
Perl scripts.

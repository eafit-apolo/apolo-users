GATK4
=====

GATK [1]_, pronounced "Gee Ay Tee Kay" (not "Gat-Kay"), stands for
GenomeAnalysisToolkit. It is a collection of command-line tools for analyzing
high-throughput sequencing data with a primary focus on variant discovery. The
tools can be used individually or chained together into complete workflows. We
provide end-to-end workflows, called GATK Best Practices, tailored for specific
use cases.

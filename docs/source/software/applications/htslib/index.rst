=====

[1] The main purpose of HTSlib is to provide access to genomic information files, both alignment data (SAM, BAM, and CRAM formats) and variant data (VCF and BCF formats). The library also provides interfaces to access and index genome reference data in FASTA format and tab-delimited files with genomic coordinates. It is utilized and incorporated into both SAMtools and BCFtools.

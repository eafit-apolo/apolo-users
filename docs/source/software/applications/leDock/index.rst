Description
-------------

LeDock is designed for fast and accurate flexible docking of small molecules into a protein. It achieves a
pose-prediction accuracy of greater than 90% on the Astex diversity set and takes about 3 seconds per run for a
drug-like molecule. It has led to the discovery of novel kinase inhibitors and bromodomain antagonists from
high-throughput virtual screening campaigns. It directly uses SYBYL Mol2 format as input for small molecules.

This software doesn't have an official nomination of its versions.

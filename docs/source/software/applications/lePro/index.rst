Description
--------------

LePro is designed to automatically add hydrogen atoms to the protein by explicitely considering the
protonation state of histidine. All crystal water, ions, small ligands and cofactors were removed.
It also generates a docking input file for LeDock with the binding site determined as to include any protein atom
within 0.4 nm of any atom of the first complexed small molecule.

This software doesn't have an official nomination of its versions.

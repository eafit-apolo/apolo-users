Partition Finder
================

PartitionFinder2 is a program for selecting best-fit partitioning schemes and
models of evolution for nucleotide, amino acid, and morphology alignments.
The user provides an alignment, and optionally some pre-defined data blocks
(e.g. 9 data blocks defining the 1st, 2nd and 3rd codon positions of 3
protein-coding genes, see Figure 1). The program then finds the best
partitioning scheme for this dataset, at the same time as selecting best-fit
models for each subset of sites/columns. Here are a few things you can
do with the program:

#. Find the best-fit partitioning scheme nucleotide, amino acid, or morphology datasets


#. Compare any number of user-defined partitioning schemes


#. Find best-fit models of evolution for each subset in any partitioned dataset (much like you might do with ModelTest or ProtTest).

PhyloNet
********

PhyloNet is a tool designed mainly for analyzing, reconstructing, and evaluating reticulate (or non-treelike) evolutionary relationships, generally known as phylogenetic networks. Various methods that we have developed make use of techniques and tools from the domain of phylogenetic networks, and hence the PhyloNet package includes several tools for phylogenetic network analysis. PhyloNet is released under the GNU General Public License. For the full license, see the file GPL.txt included with this distribution.

PhyloNet is designed, implemented, and maintained by Rice's BioInformatics Group, which is lead by Professor Luay Nakhleh (nakhleh@cs.rice.edu). For more details related to this group please visit http://bioinfo.cs.rice.edu.

Plumed
======

PLUMED is an open source library for free energy calculations in molecular systems
which works together with some of the most popular molecular dynamics engines.
Free energy calculations can be performed as a function of many order parameters
with a particular focus on biological problems, using state of the art methods
such as metadynamics, umbrella sampling and Jarzynski-equation based steered MD.
The software, written in C++, can be easily interfaced with both fortran
and C/C++ codes.

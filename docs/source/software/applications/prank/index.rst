Prank
=====

     PRANK is a probabilistic multiple alignment program for DNA,
     codon and amino-acid sequences. It’s based on a novel algorithm
     that treats insertions correctly and avoids over-estimation
     of the number of deletion events. In addition, PRANK borrows
     ideas from maximum likelihood methods used in phylogenetics
     and correctly takes into account the evolutionary distances
     between sequences. Lastly, PRANK allows for defining a
     potential structure for sequences to be aligned and then,
     simultaneously with the alignment, predicts the locations
     of structural units in the sequences. [1]_

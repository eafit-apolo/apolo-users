Pteros
======

Pteros [1]_ is a C++ library for molecular modeling. It is designed to simplify the
development of custom programs and scripts for molecular modeling, analysis of molecular
dynamics trajectories and implementing new simulation and analysis algorithms. Pteros provides
facilities, which are routinely used in all molecular analysis programs, namely input/output of
popular file formats, powerful and flexible atom selections, geometry transformations, RMSD fitting
and alignment, etc. Pteros also contains powerful facilities for parsing command-line arguments in
custom programs and for running several analysis tasks in parallel, utilizing the power of
modern multi-core processors.

Pteros supports writing analysis programs in either C++ or Python programming languages.

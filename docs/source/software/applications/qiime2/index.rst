QIIME 2 [1]_ is a powerful, extensible, and decentralized microbiome analysis package with a focus on data
and analysis transparency. QIIME 2 enables researchers to start an analysis with raw DNA sequence data
and finish with publication-quality figures and statistical results.

Key features:

    - Integrated and automatic tracking of data provenance
    - Semantic type system
    - Plugin system for extending microbiome analysis functionality
    - Support for multiple types of user interfaces (e.g. API, command line, graphical)

QIIME 2 is a complete redesign and rewrite of the QIIME 1 microbiome analysis pipeline. QIIME 2 will
address many of the limitations of QIIME 1, while retaining the features that makes QIIME 1 a powerful
and widely-used analysis pipeline.

QIIME 2 currently supports an initial end-to-end microbiome analysis pipeline. New functionality will
regularly become available through QIIME 2 plugins. You can view a list of plugins that are currently
available on the QIIME 2 plugin availability page. The future plugins page lists plugins that are
being developed.

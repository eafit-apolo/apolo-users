RAxML
=====

RAxML [1]_ (Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood) is a popular program for
phylogenetic analysis of large datasets under maximum likelihood. Its major
strength is a fast maximum likelihood tree search algorithm that returns trees
with good likelihood scores. Since the last RAxML paper (Stamatakis, 2006), it
has been continuously maintained and extended to accommodate the increasingly
growing input datasets and to serve the needs of the user community. In the
following, I will present some of the most notable new features and extensions

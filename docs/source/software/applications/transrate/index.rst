Transrate
=========

Transrate [1]_ is software for de-novo transcriptome assembly quality analysis. It examines your
assembly in detail and compares it to experimental evidence such as the sequencing reads,
reporting quality scores for contigs and assemblies. This allows you to choose between assemblers
and parameters, filter out the bad contigs from an assembly, and help decide when to stop trying to
improve the assembly.

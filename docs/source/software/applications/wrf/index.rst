The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) [1]_ Model is a next-generation mesoscale
numerical weather prediction system designed for both atmospheric research and
operational forecasting applications. It features two dynamical cores, a data
assimilation system, and a software architecture supporting parallel computation
and system extensibility. The model serves a wide range of meteorological
applications across scales from tens of meters to thousands of kilometers.

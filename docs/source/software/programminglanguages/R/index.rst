R

[1]_ R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar
to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies)
by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important
differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.

R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests,
time-series analysis, classification, clustering, …) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible.
The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source
route to participation in that activity.

MPC
===

GNU MPC [1]_ is a C library for the arithmetic of complex numbers with arbitrarily high precision and
correct rounding of the result. It extends the principles of the IEEE-754 standard for fixed precision
real floating point numbers to complex numbers, providing well-defined semantics for every operation.
At the same time, speed of operation at high precision is a major design goal.

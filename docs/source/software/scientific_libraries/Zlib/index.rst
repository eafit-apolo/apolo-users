Zlib
====

ZLib [1]_ is designed to be a free, general-purpose, legally unencumbered -- that is, not covered by
any patents -- lossless data-compression library for use on virtually any computer hardware and operating
system. The zlib data format is itself portable across platforms. Unlike the LZW compression method used in
Unix compress(1) and in the GIF image format, the compression method currently used in zlib essentially
never expands the data.

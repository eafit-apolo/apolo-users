MPFR
====

The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point computations with correct rounding. MPFR has continuously been supported by the INRIA and the current main authors come from the Caramba and AriC project-teams at Loria (Nancy, France) and LIP (Lyon, France) respectively; see more on the credit page. MPFR is based on the GMP multiple-precision library.

The main goal of MPFR is to provide a library for multiple-precision floating-point computation which is both efficient and has a well-defined semantics. It copies the good ideas from the ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for double-precision floating-point arithmetic (53-bit significand). [1]_
